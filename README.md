# Travel Insurance Prediction

## **1. Project Overview**
This project predicts whether a customer will purchase travel insurance based on their demographic and behavioral data. The goal is to assist insurance providers in identifying potential customers and optimizing marketing strategies.

Key Objectives:

- Objective 1: Build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a customer purchasing travel insurance.
- Objective 2: Develop a model with a high F1-score to handle class imbalance effectively.
- Objective 3: Ensure the model is interpretable to provide actionable business insights.

## **2. Data Sources**
(Travel Insurance Prediction Dataset)[https://www.kaggle.com/code/harinuu/travel-insurance-prediction-using-decisiontree/input]

## **3. Technologies Used**
- Programming Language: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, SHAP
- Modeling: Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Feature Engineering: ColumnTransformer, OneHotEncoder, OrdinalEncoder, RobustScaler
- Class Balancing: SMOTE
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook

## **5. Summary**
- Customers with higher income, frequent travel habits, and chronic diseases are more likely to purchase travel insurance.
- SHAP analysis shows AnnualIncome, Age, and Employment Type are key drivers of prediction.
